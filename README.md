# The RAT MCU
A microcontroller designed in VHDL which runs an assembly program designed in the RAT assembly language with a generated PROGROM.

Written by Michael Georgariou and Jack Ellison. To use this microcontroller, you must generate a bitstream using the RAT_MCU.vhd file and a prog_rom.vhd file generated for whatever assembly code you would like to run.
